         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde firſt with them to whom they owe moſt. So I alſo, right noble Earle, hauing in maner infinite perſons both here and elſewhere, which haue bounde me to them by their benefites, and bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnable to diſcharge my ſelf towards them all, haue thought it meete to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<pb facs="tcp:17192:6"/> cheefly at thoſe, which aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue after a ſorte brought me in bondage to them, by ouerloding me with their deſerts. In whiche number, foraſmuche as your Honor is not the furtheſt behinde, as who about an eight yeeres ago, at my firſt comming into England, not onely receyued mee with ſingular fauour and good will, but alſo rewarded me with very bountifull libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie, which notwithſtanding (to ſay the truthe) was the thing that I leaſt ſought for: I deemed it my dutie to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome thankfulneſſe of minde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards your Lordſhip. There are (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe) other innumerable benefites of yours towards me ſince that time, the reckening vp whereof in order one by one would be both tedious and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture not very acceptable to your Honor: who, as you haue not at any time ſticked to beſtowe your benefites vpon all ſtraungers, and ſpecially vpon ſuche as were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended to you for lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Religion: ſo beeing conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the conſcience of weldooing,
<pb facs="tcp:17192:6"/> (which is the propertie of vertue and of true bounteouſnes) you haue neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired any other thanke or commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for the ſame. Therfore although I haue many things to ſay (and that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) of your Honorable deſerts: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding for feare (as I ſayd) leaſt I might perchaunce by mine vnſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or ouergreat ſetting foorth of your prayſes, offend your noble mind, which deſpiſeth the things that we haue in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration: I willingly leaue all thoſe things, &amp; proceede to that which both beſeemeth both your excellent &amp; noble diſpoſition, and which I haue alwayes iuſtly taken to be the cheefeſt &amp; greateſt of all your benefites towards mee. For you haue not onely voutſafed to fauour me in my proſperitie (as the maner of the worlde is nowadayes) but alſo ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed your ſelfe a moſte fauourable Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone in my cheefeſt diſtreſſes (whiche is the propertie of ſingular vertue, and of perfect good will) and not ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes giuen credite to matters vnad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſedly giuen out, but (which was the
<pb facs="tcp:17192:7"/> poynt of a moſte ſtout and wiſe noble man) did vvith great Alexander keepe one eare for me, and according to the olde ſayde ſawe of Athens, gaue eare to both ſides alike, and perceyuing myne innocencie, voutchſafed alwayes ſince to imploy your authoritie and protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to my defence. By meanes whereof not onely my good name (which part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through ccrtein doubtfull reportes, and partly through the ouerlight belefe of ſome perſons, was falne in perill) abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth whole and ſound to me, ſo farre as lay in you to do: but alſo I haue more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer obteyned your wel liking &amp; good fauour: Of which things I make ſo great account, as a man of my meane ſtate ought to make of the fauour of a moſte honorable and bountifull noble man. And ſurely that dealing of yours wherby I finde my good name for the moſt part defended through your ſingular iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; wiſdome, from the reproche of infamie, is of ſo great account with me, that in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon of that alone, I take the reſidue (which notwithſtanding are
<pb facs="tcp:17192:7" rendition="simple:additions"/> very great) in maner as nothing. For vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Preacher of the doctrine of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, what can be more deare, what can be more acceptable, &amp; finally what can be greater or more to be wiſhed in this life, than a good name? So that, to my ſeeming, Salomon hath ſayd very right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that a good name is better than great riches. And contrariwiſe me thinks that chriſtian charitie is greatly impeached, not only by ſuche as bereeue their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of it by their craftie dealinges, but alſo by ſuche as credite miſreports vnaduiſedly, bicauſe that if there were none to be found which would admit miſreportes ouerhaſtily, all the whole peſtilent kind of backbiters would fade of it owne accorde, and falſe reportes would vtterly vaniſh away. And truely, if we were not blinder than Beetles, we might perceyue euen by natures direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that a good name, whiche euery good man ſetteth more ſtore by than by his life, can not be taken away from others without exceeding great wrong, and the breach of all humanitie: and
<pb facs="tcp:17192:8"/> moreouer the thing vvoulde come of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes to our remembraunce, vvhich vve reade to haue bene very diſcretly conſidered euen of the Heathen, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that God the creator of all things, beeing moſt vviſe, hath giuen to man but one tung, not to lye or ſlaunder vvith, but to expreſſe the conceiptes of his minde and hart (vvhere agaynſt it is placed) truely, playnely, and meeldly: and tvvo eares, ſo fitly placed, that we may vvell heare the things that are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to vs, bothe on the right ſide, and on the left. But to the intent I may at length come to the matter, right Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, vvhen I my ſelfe had firſt vvritten this Metaphraſis of mine in Latin vpon the Epiſtle to the Romanes, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated the ſame to my hearers: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervvarde had cauſed a friende of myne to tranſlate the ſame into Engliſhe: I purpoſed to dedicate it to your name, for the manyfolde and great benefites vvherby you holde me moſt ſtreightly bound vnto you: that wheras I am not able to make any recompence at all to
<pb facs="tcp:17192:8"/> ſo great a Lord, I might at leaſtwiſe giue him ſome inckling of thankfulneſſe. And although this preſent (if you haue an eye but to my labour only, and not to the holy Epiſtle of the Apoſtle) be neither worthy of your excellencie, nor of the benefits that I haue receyued, no nor correſpondent to my vvill: yet I hope (ſuch is the nobleneſſe &amp; great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of your mynde) that in reſpecte, not of the gift, but of the giuers mynd (vvhich ſurely is moſt forvvade to doo you ſeruice) you vvill take this ſmall vvorke of myne (ſuche as it is) in good worth. By the reading wherof if you take any profite, you ſhall thinke your ſelfe beholden for it alonely vnto our moſte gracious and almightie God, vvho by his holy ſpirite hath put theſe medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into my minde, to ſet them foorth to the common welfare of his Churche. And if the reading of this my lyttle booke ſhall confirme that opinion of yours vvhich your Honor hath concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued (&amp; not vvithout cauſe as I hope) of the pureneſſe of my doctrine: then I
<pb facs="tcp:17192:9"/> make this petition to you, (vvherof not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding I ought not to doubt) that it may pleaſe you not only to imbrace me more &amp; more vvith your good vvill and fauour: but alſo to cheriſhe &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende this vvriting by your authoritie: vvhiche although it come foorth vnder your name in the Engliſh tung as clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in a new garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, yet is it ſet out by me as a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſsion of my fayth to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and iudged by the whole church of England.

In whiche time how great curteſie I haue receyued at your handes, it is not needefull to rehearſe heere, for aſmuche as the ende of your weldooing, is not to ſeeke perishing glory among men by the ſounde of a Trumpet, but too haue it appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Therefore leauing the ſetting foorth of youre friendlineſſe tovvards mee, I vvill ſaye ſomevvhat of my dutie tovvards you, &amp; of the office of teaching, in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting whereof the Apoſtle Paule wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth his deare beloued Timothie too obſerue theſe poynts.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>2.</hi> Tim. <hi>2.</hi> and. 15.</note> Indeuer (ſayth he) to yeelde thy ſelfe a tryed vvorke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man vnto God, ſuch a one as needeth not too bee ashamed, and as deuideth the worde of truthe rightly. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle requireth heere (as I thinke) three thinges both in his ſhepheard whom he fashioneth, and in all the dealers foorth of the heauenly doctrine. The firſt is, that they ſtrayne themſelues to the vttermoſt, to yeeld the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues tried workmen vnto God, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the maner of their teaching, in no wiſe coueting the periſhing prayſe of men, &amp; muche leſſe ſtanding ouer fearfully in awe of the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of ambitious teachers. Another is, that they ſticke luſtely to
<pb facs="tcp:17192:10" rendition="simple:additions"/> the work that is inioyned them, in no wiſe being ashamed of Chriſtes Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, but gladly and cherefully imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the miſeries that are laide vpon them, and the croſſe which is wont to be the vnſeparable companion of all Chriſtes diſciples, and ſpecially of ſuch as are called too the building vp of Gods church, and labour ſtoutly ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. The third is, that they deuide the worde of truth rightly: that is to ſay, that as nere as is poſsible, they adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly ſet foorth &amp; obſerue a true Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod or order of teaching, taken out of the holy writers, and fashioned like to the patterne and practiſe of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Prophets. As touching the firſt point, Paul warneth Timothy, that he which hath the charge to inſtruct me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the faith, muſt haue his eyes caſt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god, &amp; not couet to vau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t himſelfe to the worldwarde. For witty men are wont to hunt more for the prayſe of the people, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the edifying of the Churche. Therefore the effectualleſt remedie of that leawdneſſe, is to yelde profe of our ſelues, and of our ſeruice
<pb facs="tcp:17192:11" rendition="simple:additions"/> vnto God, with whome if wee thinke our ſelues to haue to doo, all deſire of perking vp will bee gone, and we will bee muche more carefull to become faythfull ſtewards of Gods truth, than ydle diſputers of it. Setting this war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Apoſtles before mine eyes, I haue purpoſely (as neere as I coulde) abſteyned from all contentious que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions and alterations, which are wont to haue more curioſitie than profite. Agayne I conſidered howe yee haue very famous Vniuerſities, full of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent lerned men, in which I know that if any poynt of Chriſtian doctrine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more diligent opening, it is wont to be inlightned &amp; made plaine by publike diſputations: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to knit many and harde knottes, and to vnknitte them agayne, and to deuiſe curious queſtions, in the decy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding whereof there may appeare more worldly ſlight than heauenly light, in open aſſembly, where perſons igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante of holy matters, are oftentimes wont to intermingle themſelues with the learned, I thought it was no diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:17192:11" rendition="simple:additions"/> at all. Neuertheleſſe, leauing eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man free to his owne iudgement, I will make haſte to the conſidering of the Apoſtles ſeconde precept. For he willeth vs to be workmen in buylding of the Churche, and to beſtow our tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell in ſuche ſort, as the fruites of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe which our hearers ſhall bring foorth, may beare recorde of our dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in husbanding the Lordes vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yarde. And wheras he ſayth that Gods ſeruaunts and workemen muſte not in any wiſe be aſhamed: it conteyneth a notable leſſon, of the bearing of the Croſſe, which is wont to accompanie Gods faythfull miniſters. For it is not inough for them to apply their inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned charge day and night: but they muſt alſo with an vndiſcouraged mind abide the hiſsings, raylings, &amp; wrong-dealings of ſuche as paſſe by, yea and ſometymes alſo the backbytings of thoſe whoſe vineyarde they ſeeke to doo good vnto. The mynding of this precept hath brought agayne too my remembraunce, what a number of troubles and incombraunces I haue
<pb facs="tcp:17192:12" rendition="simple:additions"/> borne out, ſince the time that the lord called mee to the charge of teaching in his Churche. But to ſay the turthe playnly as it is, they for whoſe ſakes I haue taken payne theſe full ten yeres, do more comber me with their priuie maner of dealings, than other that are at open defiaunce agaynſt Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts and workmen. Wherefore lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the miſeries &amp; ſorowes of mind, wherewith men of my calling are wont to be vexed, I will ſpeake heere, but onely of thoſe incumberaunces which haue made my croſſe the gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſer, added vndoubtedly and layde vpon me by their meanes, who (if I be not deceyued) ought rather too haue beene Ioſephs of Aramathia, in hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping mee to beare the burthen of my croſſe, than to haue made it heauyer, I will not ſay importable by their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts. But to the matter. Although not with ſuche diligence as I ought to doo (for I am a man, and therefore thinke not my ſelfe priuiledged from any frayltie of man) yet too the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſte of my power I haue (too
<pb facs="tcp:17192:12" rendition="simple:additions"/> vſe Paules manner of ſpeeche) inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to make my ſelfe alowable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, in diſcharging my dutie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you moſt deere Readers. In the meane while none of both the croſſes, neither inwarde nor outwarde hathe wanted. Inwardly the changing of my function did long trouble my minde. And outwardly the miſreportes that were ſpred abrode of me and my doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, did greeue me more than can be vttered. Of mine inwarde griefe, this was not the leaſt part (for thereat will I beginne) that whereas from my very youth, all my ſtudies haue amed at this marke, namely to incourage and exhort my owne Countreymen to the exerciſes of godlyneſſe, (For of all that ten yeeres ſpace whiche I taught in Fraunce in the Frenche tung, mee thought I vvrought in another mans harueſt, and therefore vvoulde ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bynde my ſelfe too any Churche there, but executed my charge al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvayes vvyth condition, tyll opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie vvere oflered too doe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice too myne ovvne Countreymen)
<pb facs="tcp:17192:13" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſurely I could not but be greeued and ſorie at the harte, in ſo ſodaine chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of my function. For I beſeeche you, if we haue an eye but to humayne affections, what could happen more acceptable to me, after ſo many wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſes, wandrings, and paynes ſuſteined in the vprores of Fraunce and Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: than to haue found in Englande, not only a moſt ſafe and welremoued hauen from thoſe ſtreames, but alſo the readie occaſion whiche I had vvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed many yeeres afore, namely of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering a Church of mine owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen in ſome place, where I might both learne the pure doctrine of the Goſpell by teaching it, and teach it in learning it? By the goodneſſe of the Diuine Maieſtie I obteyned the thing which I had long time, and with moſte earneſt prayer ſought, and at London I gathered together my Countreymen that had forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Realme of Spaine for the Goſpels ſake: and I began to teache the doctrine of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly, not without great anguiſh and nipping griefe of minde to the
<pb facs="tcp:17192:13" rendition="simple:additions"/> enuious ſorte, but to the exceeding great ioy of the godly, and to ſuche as mind Chriſtes glory rather than their owne commodities and eſtimation. This pleaſure of minde and wiſhed quietneſſe, I could inioy no longer tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> two yeeres. In which ſpace, how much comfort, how much heauenly delight, and how great increaſe of doctrine I receyued, liuing right poorely in this Citie among my moſte poore Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen: none knowe but he who of his mercy beſtowed thoſe benefites vpon me, &amp; I that had the experience of his goodnes. But ô the craftie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiance of the olde Serpent. There wanted not enuiers of this my happie ſtate. What needeth many wordes? Satan vſing his wonted ſlightes, dyd both diſſolue and put to wrecke the ſayde congregation of outcaſte Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyards, which had forſaken their owne Countrey for religions ſake, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed themſelues into forreine Real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes: and vtterly bereeue me of the quietneſſe which I had ſcarſe taſted of with the vttermoſt part of my lippes.
<pb facs="tcp:17192:14" rendition="simple:additions"/> Verily it ſtood mee in hand in this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie, to bethinke me ageine of the Apoſtles precept, &amp; to beare this moſt cruel ſpight with a quyet mind: which thinge by the benefite of Gods grace I haue (to my ioy) performed ſo farre as mannes frayltie avoorded, verely vppon aſſurance of mine owne inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, For as the Poet ſaieth.</p>

               <l>And nother feare, ne bluſh what euer fall.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Furthermore I could here iuſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of the furtherers of this deede, and of the ſeconde cauſes as they terme them. But I thinke it better and more diſcretion, too paſſe ouer mennes vntowarde attemptes in thys behalfe with forgetfulneſſe, and too mount vp too the prouidence of the diuine maieſtie, and too beleeue that this ruine of the Spaniſh Church was made by his will, and that the ſame ſhall peraduenture fall out too grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter profit both of mee, and my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treimen than mans wiſedome can eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie. Vndowtedly for mine owne part, I perceiue my ſelfe to haue reaped no
<pb facs="tcp:17192:14" rendition="simple:additions"/> meane fruits by this change, whereof I ſee it is not the leaſt, that I haue try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the intentes of them which with their mouthes doo continually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende the ſpreadinge abrode of Gods glory, when as by their attemptes and falſe accuſations (I will not ſaye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceytes) they goo about too hinder it. But of this matter, I ſhal peraduenture ſpeake more at large heareafter. My ſpecifying of theſe things at this time is partly too the intent that my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimen which are abſent may knowe it was not long of mee, that the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Church, which was erected at Lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, continewed not vnto this day, &amp; partly bycauſe I would that this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like writing of myne ſhould beare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord both of myne innocencie, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the Goſpell amonge myne owne countrime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

<pb facs="tcp:17192:15" rendition="simple:additions"/> apparance) of refuſe ſtones, but moſte acceptable and beautifull in Gods ſight, may amende. Out of this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne ſprang alſo one other Croſſe more, which was very greeuous to me: namely the alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Language in teaching, which notwithſtanding I bare vvith a metely indifferent mind, hovvbeit (to confeſſe the truthe) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt my nature. Howe that came to paſſe I will tell you in fevve vvords. I am not ſo forgetfull of my bringing vp, as to be ignorant hovv vnable my ſhoulders are too beare the burthen that I haue vndertaken among you: neither am I aſhamed to confeſse how little I haue profited, bothe in the knowledge of humaine artes, &amp; chiefly in the exerciſe of the ſtile, and in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the eloquence of the Latin tung: neither ſurely vvill I fall oute vvith them that ſhall call mee an olde Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wand. For the Lorde knovveth hovve that I acknovvledge mine ovvne dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse and lacke of cunning, inſomuch that I chalenge none other skill too me, than the knovvledge of mine own
<pb facs="tcp:17192:15" rendition="simple:additions"/> vnskilfulneſse. And too bee at fevve vvords, no large furniture of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane tung, no readings of many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors layde vp in ſtore, no excellent knovvledge of Gods ſecretes, hathe made mee to yeelde to your election. For it vvas ynough, and more than y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough knovven to my ſelfe, how farre the abilitie of my vvit vvas vnmeet, for the charge that I tooke in hande ſpecially in a Realme ſo plentuouſly replenished vvith excellent learned men. But vvhat ſhoulde I doo? Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should I turne mee? You on the one ſide called me: and I on the other ſide vvished ſome fit meanes too ridde avvay the miſreportes that were ſpred abrode of mee (euen by ſuch as ought leaſt to haue done it) and to vvipe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvay the ſpottes of infamie that vvere ſprinkled vpon mee. Therefore being vvelneere ouervvhelmed vvith ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, I determined both to obey your vvill, and to ſatiſfie mine ovvne deſire, and I choſe rather to ſhevv hovv little I haue profited by pouring out rude and vnfiled ſpeeche in your company,
<pb facs="tcp:17192:16" rendition="simple:additions"/> tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſuffer thoſe ſuſpicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of vnpure and erronious doctrine, which myne aduerſaries had blazed abrode of mee both openly and priuily, to take dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per roote by my ſilence and ceaſsinge from my function in the churche. At one woord, neceſsitie conſtrained me to followe your requeſt. In goinge through wherwith, the ſhifting of the language was not the leaſt part of my greefe. For whereas in the Spaniſhe tung I coulde after a ſort expreſſe the meaninge of my minde: in the Latin tunge I am often tymes compelled too ſticke, too ſtamer, and too bewray myne owne childiſhneſſe. Howbeit, forasmuch as mine vnpoliſhed ſpeach is not vnacceptable vnto you, which doo rather wey the matter that is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, than with how vvell fyled termes it is vttered: I am nother vvearie nor aſhamed of the charge that I haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in hande. Nay rather I doo often thinke &amp; bethinke mee of this ſaying of S. Auſtins, that happie is that neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity vvhich driueth a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the better thinges. For this I may plainely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:17192:16" rendition="simple:additions"/> that of theſe manye yeares I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer led a meryer or happier lyfe, nor continued in my ſtudies vvith more cheerfulneſſe, and peraduenture frute alſo, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſince I began to execute the office of a teacher in your companye. And vvould God that mine olde ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries dyd not ageine enuy this my happy ſtate, and prepare nevv ſnares too incumber this my quyetneſſe: of vvhoſe vntovvard dealing ageinſt me I could heere ſay ouermuch: and truly the order of my promiſed partition, requireth that I ſhoulde recken vp here the falſe reports that are ſpred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode of mee, and diſperſe them by shevving the truth: but it is better to paſſe them ouer vvith ſilence, than to ſpeake to little of ſo wrongfull and long a matter. I wiſh no more but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, that thoſe men will gyue mee but ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g truce, as to paſſe out of this life with a quiet &amp; peſable mind. And when I am dead let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gnaw euen the ſtones of my graue if they liſt. But if the thing I wiſh ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not hape<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to me (as it befalleth not to mortal wretches to
<pb facs="tcp:17192:17" rendition="simple:additions"/> haue any thing happie in all poyntes) I vvill vvillingly in the meane vvhile both heare &amp; imbrace the croſſe that God hath prepared for me, and layde vpon me. And if the weight of it ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lode my ſhoulders, I will rather call ſome Cyrenian too mee too beare the one halfe of the burthen vppon his ſhoulders with me, than caſt it quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. But what Cyrenian ſhall I finde more friendly, or willing to eaſe mee of my burthen, than him that with his moſte ſweete wordes allureth all men to him,<note place="margin">Math. 11.</note> ſaying: Come vnto mee all yee that faynt and are ouerloden, and I will refreshe you. Therefore I beſeeche Ieſus Chriſt the only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſonne of the liuing God, &amp; ſauiour of mankinde, to helpe me in bearing of my croſſe, and ſo to holde &amp; beare vp with his moſt mightie handes, the burthen of it, which doubtleſſe is too me intolerable, as I may paciently &amp; willingly beare it with him: and that he ſuffer not my harte to bee tickled with deſire of reuenge, agaynſt ſuche as ſtayne mee, defame mee, perſecute
<pb facs="tcp:17192:17" rendition="simple:additions"/> me, &amp; trouble me. The heauenly do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine commaundeth vs to loue our enemies, and not to pay them like for like by rayling vpon them, but rather to doo good to them that hate vs, and to wiſh well to them for the wronges that we haue receyued at their hands. Therefore folowing this rule, I beſech almighty God the father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, to gyue my backebiters the ſpirit of amendment, and a better minde towards me, that by ſeeking to deface me, they hinder not the courſe of the goſpell, ſpecially among myne owne countrymen, which may heere ſome vncerteyn reportes but not the reaſons lykewiſe. God graunt at this my prayer &amp; requeſt, that the mindes of my perſecuters maye one day bee bowed &amp; turned. For, to ſpeake with a good conſcience what I thinke in my hart, I had rather contende with theſe men in the dutyes of charity, than by ſlaunderous Epiſtles, byting bookes, ſpitefull wrytings, raylings, tauntes, &amp; ſuch other (as I ſuppoſe) moſt vnſeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weapons, which eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chriſtian ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb facs="tcp:17192:18" rendition="simple:additions"/> ought to abhorre, &amp; much leſſe can in any wiſe become the preachers of the Goſpell. Therefore as long as I can, I will warde their iniuries with prayers, and vſe modeſt defences, leaſt I take harme in the meane vvhyle by holding my peace. But if I ſee them proceede in their vntovvard maner of dealing, I vvill not ſay maliciouſneſſe and rancour of minde: I will perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture deſire the Lorde to helpe me with fitte and liuely colours, wherwith to peint out the image of ſlanderouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as Apelles did, that I may diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their ſpitefull lyes, wherwith they go about to oppreſſe mine innocency. But heereof inough. Now I returne to the text of the Apoſtle. Paules thirde precept is, that the dealers foorth of the holy doctrine ſhoulde deuide the worde, of truthe aright. In the Greeke worde <hi>Orthotomein</hi> (for that vvorde anſvvereth to two Latin words) as I thinke there lieth hidde a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent alluſion to the Ceremonie of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifiſing in the olde Lavve.

               </gap>yes, from the time that the Lord cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me to this Eccleſiaſticall function, I haue indeuered not onely to dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to my hearers a pure and ſounde doctrine dravven out of the fountay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the holy Scriptures: but alſo to obſerue that way and trade of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching which the holy writers were wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to vſe in their ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.

But to mount vp yet higher, and to ſay plainly what I thinke. This moſte excellent part of the holy miniſtration, that is too wit, this skill of diuiding &amp; dealing forth, which ſothly is the diuine logike that openeth the trade of teachinge the goſpell, hath his originall of Gods cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. For euen he that maketh men fit miniſters of the new Teſtament, that is
<pb facs="tcp:17192:19" rendition="simple:additions"/> to wit, not of the letter but of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, euen he himſelfe (I ſay) gyueth the ſpirit of diſcretion to the dealer forth of his heauenly word, to know how to gyue meaſurable meale in due tyme, and alſo to haue wit to bring foorth both new thinges and old out of his ſtorehowſe, as a skilfull ſcribe in the kingdome of heauen. The not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge, (I will not ſay deſpiſing) of this heauenly &amp; diuine calling, is the cauſe that the world at this day hath, and in all ages hath had innumerable mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the word, innumerable worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and innumerable (I ſay in their owne opinion) builders and maſter-builders, who peraduenture in Gods iudgement (by whom they were not ſent, and yet they ronne) are but dirt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dawbers (or to ſay more rightly) pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers downe, ouerthrowers, &amp; deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Howbeit, foraſmuch as the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or if I may ſo terme it, the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teintie of his calling, dependeth vpon the vvitneſſe of the ſpirit in euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ovvne conſcience: I vvill leaue the iudgment therof vnto god. It is more
<pb facs="tcp:17192:20" rendition="simple:additions"/> for our behoofe to knowe, and adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly to conſider, what maner of dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling foorth God teacheth his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, that we treading in their foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteppes, may on eyther ſide doo our duetie, the teacher in deuiding the worde of truth rightly, and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer in partaking the apt and true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding of Gods word, rather than any of them both to diſgrace them ſelues with curious and ſtraunge ſifting out of things for a brauerie of their wit. And for examples ſake, let vs conſider the calling of Ieremie, whome when God choſe to take the roome of a tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher in the Churche of Ieruſalem, he inſtituted him with theſe words: See (ſayth he) I ſet thee this day ouer Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Kingdomes, to plucke vp, and pull downe, to deſtroy and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe, to builde vp, and to plant, &amp; ſo foorth. In which ſaying the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Godhead hath with moſt apte ſimilitudes, and with a certein pithy contrary matching of words, ſhewed Ieremie the heauenly Logike, whiche teacheth that the firſt point of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Goſpell, is to rid the
<pb facs="tcp:17192:20" rendition="simple:additions"/> hearers minds from co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon &amp; falſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, that the heue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly doctrine may find mens conſciences ready, &amp; plante abundance of true ſpirituall fruite in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. To ſpeake more plainly. The lawe muſt firſt play his part in vs, before the ſeede of the Goſpell be ſowed. Novve vnto the duty of the law pertein thoſe moſt pithie words of <hi>Plucking vp, pulling downe, deſtroying and ouerthrowing.</hi> And vnto the other part of the miniſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, belong the other words of <hi>building vp, and planting.</hi> How much maieſtie, grace, &amp; vneſpied learning, theſe ſimilitudes borowed of husdandrie &amp; buylding haue, the ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the other prophets ſhew, but ſpecially the ſermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is in the .xiij. of Ezechiell, which I will not put in heere, bicauſe I meane to bee ſhort. You Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (if it pleaſe you) may reade it your ſelues, and wey tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly what the lord ſaith againſt the falſe prophetes, whiche with their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged promiſes ſeduced the Churche diſperſed and baniſhed in Babylon for their wickedneſſe, and foaded them ſtill in their errours, whereas
<pb facs="tcp:17192:21" rendition="simple:additions"/> they oughte rather to haue ſet open the vvelſpring &amp; fountayne of Gods vengeaunce before the captiue peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples eyes, &amp; to haue exhorted the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to repentaunce. For in very deed it behoueth vs firſt too pull dovvne, ouerthrovv, and vndo the old things, that aftervvarde vvee may reere and build vp the nevv. But thoſe falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets delt contraryvviſe, vvhome the holy Ghoſt likeneth to euill builders, vvhich eyther for vvant of skill, or for couetouſneſſe, or being corrupted by ſome levvde affection, vndertake the botching vp of decaied howſes.

This to the Romanes he wrote from Corinth, at what time he had not yet ſeene them, but yet had herd of their faith, and was deſirous to ſee them. And firſt of all he prayſeth their faith which he herd ſpoken of euerywhere. Then doth he them to vnderſtande, that he had purpoſed to come to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the good will that he bare them, but hitherto could not. Howbeit he frameth his Epiſtle after a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb facs="tcp:17192:27" rendition="simple:additions"/> of teaching, informing them of the calling of the Gentiles, and that circumciſion ſerued but for a time, &amp; was now aboliſhed, that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſgreſſion was diſcharged by Chriſt, &amp; that the ſhadow of the Law was vaniſhed away. Therfore that the calling of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles was done conſequently in good order, he prouth in this wiſe. He ſheweth that the law is grafted in all men, and that any man may know God euen of his own mother wit by the creation and ſtate of things, without the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Law written. And therefore he doth worthely firſt of all blame the Gentiles, that wheras God hath opened the knowledge of himſelfe vnto them by the works of the world, and therwith alſo ſhewed them his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting power, which is his worde, wherin and wherby he made all things. They conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered not by the creatures, that God was the workmaſter of ſuch things, but rather aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed godhead to his creatures, and worſhipped them, rather than the maker of them. Alſo he blameth the Iewes, for that they had not kept the Law, but rather diſhonored God by breaking the Law. And ſo he rebuketh both parts, aſwell Iewes as Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles, &amp; ſhetteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp vnder the iniquity of tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſgreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to ſhewe
<pb facs="tcp:17192:28" rendition="simple:additions"/> that all men are made felowlike, and alike gyltie, and that they haue neede of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Agayne, that there was iust cauſe of the calling of the Gentiles, he ſheweth by this that grace and redemption ought to befall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like both to the Iewes and to the Gentiles, and that when the Gentiles were called, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion and the ſhadowe of the Lawe did of neceſſitie ceaſſe. For Abraham (ſayth he) beeing iustified, not in Circumciſion, but before Circumciſion, was named Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, bicauſe it ſhould come to paſſe that he ſhould be made the father of many Nations, according to the fayth which he had when he was vncircumciſed. And after that he was iustified, he receiued circumciſion in his fleſh, as a ſigne to his ofspring that ſhoulde be borne of him as concerning the fleſh, that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion ſhould ceaſſe when the Gentiles ſhould become the children of Abraham, &amp; begin to liue according to Abrahams fayth, wherethrough he was iuſtified when he was yet vncircumciſed. For whereas he was called Abram before: in respect of theſe things he was nowe called Abraham. And it was requiſite that the ſigne ſhould ceaſſe, when the things that were betokened by it
<pb facs="tcp:17192:28" rendition="simple:additions"/> were come. Wherefore if any body compell the Gentiles to be Circumciſed, they must of neceſſitie bothe take from him the name of Abraham, and call him Abram. Now ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was named Abraham by God, the Gentiles must not bee circumciſed, neither must the Jewes haue the foreskin of their fleſh cut of, to the intent that the name Abraham may abide ſtedfast, and he be called the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of many Nations. For it is not to be borne with hereafter, that any man ſhould be circumciſed, ſeeing that the fayth of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham ſuffiſeth, and there is no neede of any ſhadowe of the Lawe. For no man is iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by ſuch things, but by fayth as Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham was. When he hath proued theſe things after this faſhion, he ſheweth agayne that neither Iſraell nor the Gentiles can obteyne redemption and grace by any other meanes than by beeing quit of that auncient and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall ſinne that is ſpred into all men by Adam. But that can not be wiped away by other than by the ſonne of God, by whome alſo the curſe was made from the beginning. For it was not poſſible that any other body ſhould diſcharge that trespaſſe. Afterward he writeth, that that thing was not done by
<pb facs="tcp:17192:29" rendition="simple:additions"/> any other meanes, than that the ſonne of God tooke fleſhe vpon him, and became man, that he might deliuer all men from death, by offering vp the ſame body for all, which was ſubiect to the ſame ſufferings that wee bee. And like as by one man ſinne entred into the worlde, ſo alſo by one man grace came vpon all men. From the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cefoorth as a good ſteward he comforteth the Jewes, telling the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they ſhall not be tranſgreſſers of the Law, if they beleeue in Christ, and warneth ſuche of the Gentiles as beleeued, that they ſhould not be puffed vp agaynſt the Iſraelites, but conſider that as the boughes are grafted into a tree, ſo were they grafted into the Jewes. When he hath finiſhed theſe things, he addeth exhortations to good maners, and ſo endeth his Epistle.</p>

                  <hi>No: But you shall vnderſtande <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the whole cace the better, if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the wages wyth the gyfte. For vnto hym that woorketh, wages is gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of duetie and not of revvarde. But too hym that woorketh not, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> beleeueth in hym that maketh the offender gyltleſſe: hys firme and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſte fayth is imputed for innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.

               <p>Nowe I perceiue whereto theſe thinges tende. For that is the cauſe why he was called Abraham, whereas hys name was Abram before: to the intent that he might from tyme to tyme be put in mynd of Gods promiſe, as oft as that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17192:67"/> name was reherſed. And that cuſtome was conueied ouer to his poſterity from their forefather, who were wont to giue their children their names at the circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of them, that they might remember the couenaunt when they hearde their owne names that were giuen them at that tyme. But to let this matter paſſe, me thinkes you teache ſcarce agreeable things, in referring promiſes which (as it ſhoulde ſeeme) were but tranſitorie &amp; worldly, yea and alredy performed, vnto ſpirituall matters, as namely to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption that is made by faith, &amp; to ſuche other thinges. For the ſcriptures beare witneſſe that God performed his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes abundantly vnto Abraham, whom he ſo appoynted to be the father of many nations, firſt when he rayſed vp twelue noble and mightie tribes of his ſonne Iſmael whom he begat of Agar: and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he increſed other twelue moſt floriſhing houſes out of Iacob the ſon of Iſaac.

For when I ſay that Abraham was appointed of God to be the father of many nations and people: I loke not vpon the world, but vppon God, I ſay vppon the almightie God, whome Abraham beleeued in all things, and which is able to raiſe vp the dead from their graues, &amp; which dooth as certeinly and by name ſet before him ſelfe the things that haue not yet bin, as the things that are already preſent.

               <p>If I be not deceaued, you ſeeme to betoken two things vnto mee. The one is, how great difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the children of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of whom the one ſorte being puffed vp with the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:17192:68"/> nobleneſſe of their birth, do boaſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and will needes be counted Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams ſeede: and the other ſort are adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be his children by fayth. For as the former ſorte vaunt themſelues to the worldward: ſo theſe are knowen and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant only to God. Thoſe are begotten of the fleſh: &amp; theſe are taken in by faith. Thoſe knowe Abraham for their father but as touching the fleſh: and theſe are counted his children in ſpirit and fayth. Againe I marke how wonderfull Gods power ſhone forth in that cace: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon Abraham reſting, dyd by fayth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and comprehend in mynde and fayth, things wonderfull and aboue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures reach. For what is it that Gods power is not able to doo? Therefore if we ſettle our truſt vppon that, it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſwarue, it can neuer be remoued, it can neuer quayle. But to the intent I may call to minde the thinges that you haue ſayd heere before: firſt you haue ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iews as well as the Greeks (in whiche two names all mankinde is conteyned) are ſo in thraldome vnto ſin, that they can neuer returne into Gods
<pb facs="tcp:17192:69"/> fauour for any deedes or deſerts of their owne: and therefore that there remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth but onely one way to ſaluation, namely euen fayth, which is ingreffed and inſpired into our mynds by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, by the help whereof he pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vp the rootes of naturall ſin out of our mynds, and dryueth diſtruſt or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe a great way from our harts, and thruſteth out of our breſts the doubting of Gods mercie and the feare of his wrath, which Satan had thruſt in by his falſe perſuaſions. Secondly it is ſhewed that the ſtrength of fayth is ſo great, that the man which of himſelfe is hedged in with all kynd of wickedneſſe, is adorned with Gods ryghtuouſnes and holines, whereby he may becomme acceptable &amp; welcome vnto God. Neuertheleſſe, in theſe days I ſee very many ouerſeene in the cace of fayth. Of whom ſome ſurmiſe fayth to be but a worldly opinion and perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gotten by reading of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures or by hearing of mens ſermons. Otherſome are proud of this counterfet and imaginatiue fayth, and do brag of it beyond all meaſure: &amp; bicauſe it is barren
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:17192:69"/> and vtterly fruteleſſe, it is comonly dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be but a certen deuice and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit of men. Wherefore I pray you hartely to peynt it out to me in lyuely colours, &amp; to ſet as it were an expreſſe image of it before myne eyes, that may ſink ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in my mind, as I may not ſurmiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny feyned and counterfet, or anie vaine thing to my ſelfe.

               <p>Surely you tell a wonderfull, and welneare a monſtruous thing. The thing that you deſire to conclude (as I take it) is this: that we muſt lift vp our eyes from the beholding of worldlye things into heauen, and that fayth muſt conſider not ſo muche the wiſdome of men as the mightie power of god. For
<pb facs="tcp:17192:71"/> in thinges that are aboue nature, there is no roome for mans wiſdome, whiche if Abraham had followed for his guide, peraduenture he might haue doubted of Gods promiſes, whereas by ſetting light by it, and by paſſing it ouer, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode alwayes like him ſelf, conſtant and vnouercome.</p>

                  <hi>In deede it is true as you ſay: and theſe things require the practiſe of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe &amp; the experience of iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For before that time, ſin and mans wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked concupiſence are ſo ſtyrred vp, that ſin becommeth out of meaſure ſinfull and euill, inſomuch that death is ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of ſin and the law, not through a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> fault of the lawe, but of ſin. For the law, as much as in it lyeth, gyueth lyfe
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:17192:92"/> by ſhewing vs the way of lyfe. But for as much as the law is ſpiritual, it requireth of vs not onely the outward deeds, but alſo the inwarde affections of the hart. Alſo it requireth of vs all diuine vertues in their full perfection, togither with their fruits and deeds proceading from a godly inſtinct &amp; tending to the glory of God. Now I at that tyme being yet earthly, and more ouer a bondſlaue of ſin (as you and all others were when ye had not yet receaued the ſpirit of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſſe) was not able to diſcerne the dignity, holineſſe and excellency of the lavv, and much leſſe was vvilling to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my necke vnder the yoke of it, too frame both my mind and all my doings according to the preciſe rule therof.</hi>

               <p>Suerly I haue often tryed this, and I finde it true, that it is not all in my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, not onely to loue God with all my hart, to haue a perfect beleefe in him, to hope for all thinges at his hand, to loue other men (ſpecially to loue myne ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes with all my hart, and that only for Gods glories ſake) to be indued with all Chriſtian vertues as perfect as is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:17192:93"/> as the rightuous and holye lawe of God byndeth me: but not euen to rule the affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of my mind, to be at a word, ſurely I feele, that without Gods grace and the ſpirit of rightuouſneſſe, I cannot but loue my ſelfe and worldly things to much, I cannot loue God aboue all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall things, and much leſſe with all my whole hart, nother can I fall to harty at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement with myne enemies, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther euen yet ſtill I am inforced I wote not how, to hate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, bycauſe I am earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and the ſeruaunt of ſin and concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, which reigning tyrannouſly in me do ouer rule me, and harrie me about at their vnbridled pleaſure, nother am I able too wyth ſtande them of my ſelfe.</p>

                  <hi>Theſe thinges are very modeſtly ſpoken, but I hope it is better vvith you than you ſpeake of. In the meane tyme I am glad to heere this your accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For you ſpeake by experience, and I coniecture by your vvoords that you haue bin a verie diligent examiner of your ſelfe. For all men perceiue not this tyranny of ſinne. But I vvill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede to declare in my ſelfe vvhat is
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:17192:93"/> vvont to happen to ſuche as are in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating. Surely I vviſt not vvhat too do. I put you out of doubt I doo many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> things that I acknovvledg not for mine ovvne: For I doo not the good vvhiche I vvould doo, but the euill vvhich I hate that commit I oftentymes.

If I do that I vvould not then loke vvhat the lavv forbiddeth, that doo I hate as vnright, and I miſlyke of it, but the thing that the lavv commaundeth lyketh my minde very vvell.

               <p>By this your ſpeache, and by your acknowledginge of your former ſtate, I ſee nowe there are twoo kyndes of men, ſome are vtterly laweleſſe, and
<pb facs="tcp:17192:94"/> though they do alwayes obey ſinne, yet feele they not the ſtinges of ſin at all. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine there are otherſome which haue I wore not what a heauenly ſeed with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and although they ſin, and now and then obey the affections of ſin, yet do they it of all the while as it were vnwillingly, ſo as the iudgement of their mind ſtryueth againſt it. But yet as I thinke, theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſort haue no excuſe at all in the ſight of God, although they be earthly. For that ſame willingneſſe and forewardnes of mynd, whereby they be glad and faine of the good, is ſo weake and faynt, that now and then they ſuffer themſelues too be led wholly by their vnbrydled luſtes, wheras contrariwiſe it ought be ſo effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, mightye, ſtout, and conſtant, as to outſtande ſin when it woulde ouerrule them.</p>

For eyther I am vtterly deceiued, or elſe in thoſe men that I ſpake laſt of, there is ſome knowledge of gods will: alſo there are alreadie in them ſome ſparkes of commendable likings and deſires, howebeit that theſe things bee not in the fleſhe, whiche regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth nothing but hir ſelfe and hir owne pleaſures.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:17192:95"/> great wrong to the eternal God. For to the intent I maye make theſe thinges playne in mine owne perſon, truly there is in mee a will to doo good, but I finde not any way to perfourme it. For I am hindered by the fleſh, and by ſinne that reigneth in me, and I am caried away <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> vnto euil, ſo as I do not the good which I vvould doo, but I doo the euill which I am lothe to doo. Wherfore if I do the thing that I vvould not, then is it not I that doo it, but ſinne that dwelleth in me: which doth ſo roughly ouermaſter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> me, when the power and working of Gods ſpirite is abſent vvhereby victorie is obteyned, that I am compelled to do the thing vvhich my reaſon in lightened by the law of God doth vtterly abhor. Therefore in that I vvould do good and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> can not, I finde and perceiue by the lawe, while it playeth his part in mee, that there is euil in me, in me (I ſay) for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as I am earthly &amp; weake, and vnable to performe it, &amp; not in the law. For, that I may vtter the meaning of my minde as plainly as can be, I delight <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> in gods law as in reſpect of my inwarde
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:17192:95"/> man: that is to ſay, as in reſpect of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon inlightened by Gods law, gods law doth pleaſe me, and delight me, I allow it to be rightfull, I agree with it, and I would fayne obey it. But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> part, I ſee, feele, and find by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience another law in my members, &amp; in the ſences, powers, &amp; abilities of my ſoule, contrary to the law of my minde, and fighting agaynſt it. For when as by the iuſt and holy law of my mind I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue what is right and allow of it, and delight in it as good, and vvolud fayne do it: therwithall the wicked law of my body counſeleth &amp; inticeth me to the contrarie, and this lawe deliuereth me priſoner to the law of ſinne: inſomuch that I am oftentimes inforced to crye <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> out: vvretch that I am, vvho ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer me from the body of this death? May any man deliuer me from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and burthen of ſinne that killeth me out of hande?

               <p>By thys youre diſcourſe Paule, I perceiue well, not onely the loue that God beareth vs, but alſo the conſtancie, ſtedfaſtneſſe, and ſtableneſſe thereof, in ſomuch that I am ſure it cannot by any meanes be brought too paſſe, that God ſhoulde not loue vs in Chriſt Ieſus as his members, or that we ſhoulde not alwayes loue him againe. How be it, as I perceiue by the order which you haue ſet downe, you haue hytherto treated of Chriſten ryghtuouſneſſe, and you haue ſhewed playnely that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Gentyles can becomme cleere by keepinge of the lawe of nature,
<pb facs="tcp:17192:109"/> nor the Iewes by the workes of the law written, bycauſe none of both them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements of Gods will to the full, which require to be kept to the vttermoſt tittle. And therfore there is offered vs a moſt preſent remedy by the preaching of the Goſpel, namely that we may becomme rightuous by belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in Chriſt, &amp; being indued with his ſpirit giue our ſelues wholly to the due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of obedience, ſo as at length we may attaine euerlaſting happines with Chriſt the head of all the faithfull. But now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth the greateſt hardeneſſe of this Epiſtle. For if men be iuſtified by fayth, and Chriſt belong but onely to the bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers: vndoubtedly then is the ſeed of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham caſt of. For (as you your ſelf ſee) very few of Abrahams ſeed receiue Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſts doctrine. Wherupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe that ſome ſaye flatly that this Ieſus of Nazareth is not the true Meſſias that was promiſed to the people of Iſraell: and otherſome affirme that he is the true Meſſias, but that God abydeth not by his promiſes, but reiecteth it at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.

                  <hi>Let that matter neuer trouble you. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> For if the fall of the Iewes be the welth of the woorlde, and the adminishing of them the inriching of the Gentyles: how much more shall their fulneſſe &amp; ſafenes be ſo?

For if thou beeing cut <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> out of a naturall wild O life, wert againſt nature greffed into a true Olife: hovve muche more ſhall they that are the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall braunches be greffed into their ovvne Olife agayne?</hi>

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:17192:150"/> rule, if it be lightened with ſome exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. The reaſon of like things is euer al one. Marke I pray you. He that maketh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> a conſcience of dayes, and putteth dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene day &amp; day, according to the commandement of Moyſes law, do the it out of doubt leaſt the Lorde ſhould be offended who had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a difference of dayes in his law: for he hath not yet learned the chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie concerning the aboliſhing of the difference of dayes. And therfore he is rather to be prayſed than diſprayſed: that he dare not do any thing without warrant of his conſcience. Contrariwiſe he that regardeth not dayes, but taketh all dayes to be alike, without putting of any difference betweene holy and vnholy: doth it alſo for the Lawes ſake, bicauſe he knovveth he may freely vſe the liberty of the goſpel. After the ſame maner muſt you iudge of the choyſe of meates. For he that eateth the meates that are forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Moſes law, ſo he be indued with chriſtian libertie, eateth vnto the Lord, for he giueth god tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks. And he that abſteineth bicauſe of the
<pb facs="tcp:17192:151"/> weaknes of his faith, abſteineth to the Lord, &amp; giueth god thanks aſwel as the other. You ſee then how both of them do honor god, &amp; that god only (if you conſider the whole matter throghly) is the iudge of both thoſe doings. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſee it is reaſon that wee ſhould beate downe this loftines of our minde, wherthrogh we either deſpiſe or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne one another, &amp; leaue all power of iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vnto god alone, either to acquit or conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, ſpecially ſith we be all his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> For none of vs al liueth to himſelf, neither doth any of vs dye to himſelfe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> For if we liue, we liue vnto the Lord: &amp; if we dye, we dye vnto the Lorde. To be ſhort, there is no cauſe why wee ſhould ſtand ſcanning about meats, or dayes, or other meane things: but the cheefe thing wherabout we ſhould imploy all our wits, is that whether we liue or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> we dye, vve may be the Lords. For euen for that cauſe did Chriſte dye and riſe agayn to lyfe, namely that he might <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> be Lorde both of quick and dead. Now then why doeſt thou (you knovve to whom I ſpeake) why doeſt thou (I ſay)
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:17192:151"/> condemne thy weak brother, vvhich is rather worthy to be pitied than to be ſcorned, for whoſe ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt died? And thou that boaſteſt of thy chriſtian liberty, why art thou ſo proude to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain thy brother with ſuch a lofty loke? Surely thou oughteſt not to blame him of vnbeleefe for that fearfull maner of dealing of his: but rather co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſter it with a welmeaning mind, &amp; leaue the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it to god, and to his Chriſte. For all of vs ſhall come before Chriſtes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſeat, as the holy ſayings of the holy ſcriptures vvitnes.</hi>

                  <hi>I will make my meaning playne vnto you concerning this matter in few words. I know and am fully perſuaded by the light of faith throgh Ieſus chriſt, that nothing is of the own nature vnho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or vncleane, that it ſhould defile thy minde. Therfore it is free for thee to eate what thou liſteſt, ſo it agree vvith thy nature. For Chryſtes preſence putteth awaye all ſhaddovves of the lawe, and all kindes of meate are pure
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:17192:152"/> and cleane to ſuch as are pure &amp; cleane, that is to wit, to true beleuers, ſo that nothing is of it ſelf vnholy or vncleane. But marke what I ſay, a thing is vnholy, onely to him that thinks it vnholy. As for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple. Some ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thinks he ſinneth in eating: now muſt he either forbeare eating, or els caſt away that ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſcrupiloſitye of his. And if he eate withoute putting of it awaye oute of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> doubt he ſinneth. Again, if by reaſon of thy fre eating without making any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of meats, thy brother be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſo as he thinketh amiſſe of thee, or at leaſtwiſe if he fall not out with thee openly, is touched with inwarde greefe: ſurely now is not this deede of thine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greing to chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> charity, bicauſe thou eateſt meats forbidden in the law, in his preſence. To co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude in few words, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all kynd of meats are cleane of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, &amp; thou knoweſt it: and therfore thou maiſt frely eat of whatſoeuer thou liſt. But yet muſte this liberty of thine follow charity, and thou muſt forbeare if thou ſe that the weaklings ſhall be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at thyne eating. For although
<pb facs="tcp:17192:153"/> thou be fre, yet art thou not compelled to eat: but thou art euermore bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not to offend others, &amp; therefore thou ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt in ſo doing if thou eate.</hi>

Whoſe gentlenes I beſeech you to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in bearing one vvith another, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> to releeue the weake brethren like as Chriſt releeued vs, &amp; bare with vs, only to the end to glorifie his father, and our
<pb facs="tcp:17192:157"/> glorious god. I knowe you haue very many of my countrey men among you, which are ſtil feble &amp; weak in the faith: but you muſt haue a care of them after the example of Chriſt, &amp; you muſt ſet before your eyes the footſteps of that heauenly maſter, who notwithſtanding that the Jewes were neuer ſo vnworthy, did yet voutſafe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch honor for the couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts ſake that was made vnto their fathers, that he bare the roome euen of a ſeruant among them with incredible patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.

                  <hi>It becommeth not Chriſtes Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and the preachers of the goſpell, to deface any men by name for light cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or to bring them in ſuſpition with the whole Churche by their writings.

               <p>Our Church hath learned by it own experience, that theſe things whiche you ſay, are too true. For at the beginning, when the goſpell was preached to vs in houſes and priuately, many who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe were none euill men, would not be preſent at our priuie aſſemblies. Nowe, ſome of our company did of a good zeale ſoothly, but yet vnaduiſed (as I think) fall to taunting and girding at them by name, wherby they made a great ſort of them become aduerſaries to vs, &amp; moſte deadly enemies to the goſpell: whereas if they had bin handled with ſuche Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall mildneſſe as you vſe heere to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards theſe men, out of doubte there was great hope of meekening them, and of bringing them agayne to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie.</p>

               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therfore take ye warning by their example, to eſchue this vntowarde ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of dealing, and rather follow Chriſt,
<pb facs="tcp:17192:167"/> who giuing to Ceſar that whiche was Ceſars, and leauing the correction of vices vnto Magiſtrates, did hurt no man by name, wrate no reprochfull libels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt any man, ne bronded no man with the mark of infamy, but behaued himſelfe with a moſt meeke &amp; modeſt mind towards all men, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> though they were his enemies of ſet purpoſe. It is inough for you if you keepe watch with al diligence as it were in a watch tower, and ſpy out ſuche contention in your Church, &amp; ſuch as lay ſtumbling blocks in the way of the weaklings, eyther by their lyfe, or by euill and lewde perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions contrarie to the doctrine vvhiche you haue learned.

                  <hi>Chriſt hath ſet down many marks whereby to diſcerne falſe teachers, and falſe prophets, whiche (I beleeue) you haue learned. But here I will poynt you out ſome, whiche in my opinion may make you ware &amp; wiſe inough. Let the firſt marke be this, which is of two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. When you ſee any teachers and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> preachers of the goſpel, which ſerue not
<pb facs="tcp:17192:168"/> the Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, but their owne bellies: ſhun you them as moſte cruell Wolues.</hi>

               <speaker>P.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>In that ſpeech I comprehend ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things whiche it were needeleſſe to open ſeuerally as now. But conſidering the circumſtance of our talke, to ſerue Chriſte in the preaching of the goſpell, is to acknovvledge Ieſus Chriſt to be our maſter, and to win ſeruants &amp; diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples vnto him alone, and not to our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues. To ſpeake more plainly, when you ſee a teacher ſet vp a ſchole of his owne to him ſelfe, to win ſcholars or diſciples to him ſelfe, and taking no care for the catholike and vniuerſall church, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther labouring to purchaſe him ſelfe many friends, fellowes, prayſers and comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders of his ſermons &amp; writings: him eſchue you. For beleeue me, that teacher ſerueth not the Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, but himſelfe: he ſeekes not the glory of the Redemer, but of himſelfe: and all his intent is by all meanes to prouide for his belly. And by the name
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:17192:168"/> of <hi>Belly,</hi> you muſt vnderſtand, not only feaſting and all maner of deynty fare, but alſo riches, vaine glory, and fame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue other men, whiche they are wont to hunt for by all meanes eyther ryght or wrong: and ſo they maye beare the bell, and haue preheminence amonge men, they paſſe not for the bondes of Chriſten charity which elſe they extoll with wondrous commendacions.</hi>

                  <hi>I vſe here two termes which paint out the nature of hipocrites, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfets verie plainly: for they be full of faire ſpeech. The Greekes call him faire ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which promiſeth much in words and performeth nothing in deede, and alſo ſuch a one as if you heere him, you would ſay he is more carefull of you &amp; your welfare than of his owne, when in the meane while all his ſeeking is but to
<pb facs="tcp:17192:169"/> pleaſure himſelfe. With this vertue are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> theſe belly flatterers garniſhed (if I may ſo terme them to you after the greeke fashion) which are to be ſhunned more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a dog or a Snake.

Yea and euen in our ſelues there is vice and corruption ynough, ſo as god needeth not to ſheade any new increaſe of naughtineſſe into vs. Therfore when the ſcriptures reporte God to hardned men, to blynd men, &amp; to deliuer them vp into a leud mynd, it is to be vnderſtood that God doth it by rightfull iuſtice, as a ryghtuous iudge and iuſt puniſher. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally as oft as God in the holy ſcripture is ſayd or ſeemeth to do any euil it is not ment therby that man doth not the euill, but that God by his iuſt iudgement, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth it to be done, and letteth not the doing of it, wheras he coulde let it if he lyſted: eyther bycauſe he vſeth mans euil doings to good purpoſe, as he vſed the ſin of Ioſephs brethren: or bycauſe he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerruleth mens ſins that they burſt not out ne rage further than is meete. By a wonderfull &amp; vnſpeakable meane (ſayth Saint Auſtin in his Enchiridion or ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,) it is not done without his will, for it ſhould not be done, vnleſſe he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it to be done.

As for theſe queſtions whether it was Gods will that Adam ſhould fall, and whether he draue him to fall, or why he letted not his fal, and ſuch other lyke, I recken them among the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſort, except it be perchance when the leudneſſe of Heretikes or of other importunate perſons, inforceth men to open thoſe thinges out of Gods worde, as the godly teachers of the church haue often times done. For we know that the Lord forbad man to eate of the frute, and puniſhed his tranſgreſſion, and moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer that the things whiche are done are not euill in reſpect of Gods prouidence, will, and power, but in reſpect of Satan and of oure wyll ſtryuing againſt Gods will.</p>

               <p>In this matter, which hath euer bred manye contentions in the Churche,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2</note> I thinke we muſte conſider man in three ſtates or conditions. Firſt what he was
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:17192:179"/> before his fall: to wit, ryghtuous &amp; free, ſo as he might both abyde in the good, and ſwarue vnto the euill: and that he ſwarued vnto euill, and wrapped both himſelfe &amp; all mankind in ſin and death, as hath bin ſaide afore. Againe it is to be conſidered in what plyght man was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his fall. Surely his vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding &amp; will were not taken quite from him, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was he vtterly turned into a blocke or ſtone:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ephe.</hi> 12.</note> howbeit they were ſo chaunged and diminiſhed, that they could no more do as they did before his fall. For his vnderſtanding was darkened: and hys will, of free became bond. For it ſerueth ſin, not vnwillingly, but willingly. For it is called a will and not a nill. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as in reſpect of euill or of ſin, man doth it not as compelled eyther of God or of the diuell, but of his owne accorde: and in that behalfe his will is moſt free. And whereas we oftentymes ſee mens wicked doinges and deuices letted by God, ſo as they come not to effect: that taketh not away mans freeneſſe in euill, but God diſappointeth that thinge by his power, whiche man had freely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in him ſelfe. As for example,
<pb facs="tcp:17192:180"/> Ioſephs brethren determined freely to ridde him oute of the waye: But yet they could not, bycauſe Gods ordy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was otherwiſe. But as for in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of goodneſſe and vertue, mans vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding doth not of it ſelfe iudge ryghtly of godly matters. For the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures both of the Goſpel and of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles wrytings, requyre regeneration of euery of vs that wilbe ſaued. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it followeth that our former birth in Adam, boteth vs nothing at al to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. For the naturall man (ſayeth Paule) perceiueth not the thinges that come of Gods ſpirit.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.</note> &amp;c. And in another place he denyeth vs to be able to thinke any good thought of our ſelues.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.</note> Now it is certen that the mind or vnderſtanding is the guyde of the will: and if the guyd be blynd, it is eaſy to perceyue whyther the will goeth. Therfore ther is not any free will vnto good in any man vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, nother is there any ſtrength in hym to eſpy the thing that is good. Our Lord ſayth in the Goſpell,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>John.</hi> 8.</note> verily verily I ſay vnto you, that euery one whiche committeth ſin is the bondſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of ſinne.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</note> And the Apoſtle Paule
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:17192:180"/> ſayth that the luſt of the fleſh is enmitie agaynſt God: For it is not ſubiecte to Gods lawe, neither can be. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, the vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of earthly things is not quite gone in man. For God of his mercy hath lefte him wit, howbeit farre vnlike that which was in him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this fall. God willeth men (as it were) to manure their wittes, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth giftes and proceedings therwithal. And it is manifeſt how little or nothing we profite in any art without gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. For ſurely the Scripture fathereth all artes vpon God. And euen the very heathen men fathered the originall of all arts vpon the inuention of their Gods. Laſt of all it is to be ſeene, whether the regenerated haue freewil, and how farre forth. In regeneration mans vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is inlightened by the holy ghoſt, to vnderſtande Gods myſteries and will. And his will is not onely chaunged by the ſpirite, but alſo indewed with abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſo as it both will and can doo good of it owne accorde.<note place="margin">

Againe Paule to the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians, ſayth: vnto you it is giuen not onely to beleeue in him, but alſo to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for him. And againe, I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that he which hath begon the good worke in you, will go through with it euen to the day of our Lord Ieſu. Again it is God that worketh in you both the will and the performance of the will. Where by the waye, I teache that two thinges are to be marked. Firſte that in the chooſing and working of good, the regenerated are not onely ſufferers, but alſo dooers. For by Gods working in them, they do the things which they do. And therfore rightly doth Auſtin alledge this text, that God is ſayde to be our hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. But none can be helped, but he which doth ſomewhat. The Manichies bereeued man of all dooing, and made him as a ſtocke or a ſtone. Secondly I
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:17192:181"/> make, that in the regenerated there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth infirmitie. For aſmuche as ſin dwelleth in vs, and the fleſhe fyghteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte the ſpirite in the regenerated, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the ende of our lyfe: the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated performe not their purpoſes alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyther withoute incomberance. Theſe thinges are confirmed by the Apoſtle in the ſeuenth to the Romanes, and in the fift to the Galathians. And therfore that freedome of oure wyll is weake, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the dregges of the olde Adam, and of the corruption that is bred and borne with man, and remayneth in vs euen to the ende of our lyfe. Notwithſtanding for aſmuch as the ſtrength of the fleſhe and the remnants of the old man are not ſo effectuall, as vtterly to quenche the working of Gods Spirite: therefore the faithfull are ſaide to be free, but yet ſo as they acknowledge their owne weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and boaſt not at all of the freedome of their will. For the faithfull muſt euer beare in minde, this ſaying which Saint Auſtin harpeth vpon ſo muche out of the Apoſtle:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mar.</hi> 11.</note> what haſt thou which thou haſt
<pb facs="tcp:17192:182"/> not receyued? and if thou haue receyued it, why boſteſt thou as though thou had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt not receyued? Moreouer, the thing that I had determined doth not foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with come to paſſe: For the fallings out of things are in gods hand. And thervp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon S. Paule prayeth the Lord to proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per his iourney.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.</note> Therefore euen in that reſpect mans freewill is weake. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe no man denieth but that bothe the regenerated and the vnregenerated haue freewill in outwarde things. For man hath this propertie common to him with all other liuing things (to whome he is not inferiour) namely to will ſome things, and to nill other ſome. So can he ſpeake or holde his peace, and goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode or tarie at home: howbeit that euen in this behalfe an eye muſt always be had to Gods power, whiche cauſed that Balaam coulde not attayne to the mark that he ſhot at, nor Zecharie ſpeake as he woulde haue done when he came out of the Temple: In this caſe I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the Manichees which denie that mans freewill when he was good, was the beginning of euill vnto him. Alſo I condemne the Pelagians, which ſay that
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:17192:182"/> an euill man hath ſufficient free will to do a good commaundement. For they be diſproued by the holy ſcripture, which ſayth vnto the one ſort, God made man righteous: and vnto the other, if the ſonne make you free, then are you free in deede.</p>

Now vnto him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> worketh not but beleueth in him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> iuſtifieth the vngodly, his faith is imputed to him for rightuouſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe. And againe, you be ſaued by grace
<pb facs="tcp:17192:184"/> through fayth, &amp; that not of yourſelues, but it is gods gift. Not by works, leaſt any man ſhoulde glory.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2.</note> For aſmuche then as fayth receyueth Chriſt our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and imputeth all things to Gods free fauour in Chriſt: therfore is iuſtification fathered vpon fayth, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit for Chriſtes ſake, and not bicauſe it is our worke, for it is the gifte of God. But that we receyue Chriſt by fayth, the Lorde himſelfe ſheweth by many words in the ſixth of Iohn, where he putteth eating for beleeuing, and beleeuing for eating. For like as we receiue foode by eating, ſo doo wee participate of Chriſte by beleeuing. Therefore I deuide not the benefite of Iuſtification partly to Gods grace or to Chriſt, and partly to our ſelues, or to our owne charitie and works, or to our owne deſeruing: But I attribute it wholly to Gods free fauor in Chriſt by fayth. Beſides this our loue and works could not pleaſe God if they were done of vs beeing yet vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: and therefore it behoueth vs to be firſt iuſtified, before we can loue or doo good works. But we be iuſtified (as I ſayde afore) by fayth in Chriſte, through
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:17192:184"/> the onely grace of God, who imputeth Chriſtes ryghtuouſneſſe to vs and not our owne ſinnes, and conſequently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth oure beleeuing in Chriſt vnto vs for ryghtuouſneſſe. Furthermore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth very apparently deryue loue from fayth,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2</note> ſaying the ende of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement is loue from a pure harte, good conſcience, and vnfeyned fayth. Therefore in this cace I ſpeake not of a feyned, empty, ydle, or dead fayth: but of a lyuely and quickening fayth, which for Chriſts ſake who is our lyfe and quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vs, whom it taketh hold of, both is and is ſayde to be lyuely, &amp; ſo ſheweth it ſelfe to be by lyuely workes. No whit at all therefore is S. Iames contrary to this doctrine,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.</note> forſomuch as he ſpeaketh of an empty and dead fayth, which ſome men did boaſt of, whereas they had not Chriſt lyuing in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by fayth. The ſame Iames in ſaying that workes iuſtify, is not contrary to Paule, for then were he to be reiected: but he ſheweth that Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham vttered a liuely and iuſtifying faith, by his works, which thing all the godly do, who notwithſtanding truſt all only vnto Chriſt and to no woorkes of their
<pb facs="tcp:17192:185"/> owne. For the Apoſtle hath ſayd againe, Now doo not I lyue, but Chriſte lyueth in me. The lyfe that I nowe lyue in the fleſhe, I lyue by beleeuing in the ſonne of God, who loued me and gaue himſelfe for me. I hold no ſkorne of Gods grace: For if ryghtuouſneſſe come by the lawe, then hath Chriſt dyed in vaine.</p>

So then, Gods chooſing of vs is not withoute a meane, though it be not for any deſert of ours, but in Chriſt and for Chriſt: ſo that they whiche are now greffed into Chriſt
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:17192:185"/> by fayth, are the ſelfe ſame alſo whiche are choſen, and the reprobates or caſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes are thoſe that are out of Chriſte: according to this ſaying of the Apoſtle, Try your ſelues whether you be in the fayth or no. Knowe ye not your ſelues,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13</note> how that Ieſus Chriſt is in you? vnleſſe perhappes you be caſtawayes. Finally God hath choſen the Sayntes in Chriſte to a certen ende, which the Apoſtle decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in that he ſayth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ephe.</hi> 12.</note> he hath choſen vs in him to the ende we ſhoulde be holy and vnrebukable through loue before hym, which did predeſtinate vs afore hande in himſelfe to adopte vs to be his children through Ieſus Chriſt, to the glory of his grace. And although God know whiche are his, and that in ſome places mention is made of the feweneſſe of the choſen: yet oughte we to hope well of all men,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phl.</hi> 1</note> and not to be raſh in reckening any man to be a reprobate. Surely Paule to the Philippians ſaith, I thank God for you all, (he ſpeaketh of the whole churche of the Philippians) that you are come to the communion of the Goſpell, aſſuring my ſelf y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he which hath begon the good worke in you, will alſo go through with
<pb facs="tcp:17192:186"/> it, and meete it is that I ſhould ſo thinke of you all. And in the xiij. of Luke when the Lord was aſked whither few ſhould be ſaued: he anſwereth not that there ſhalbe few, or many ſaued or da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned: but rather counſeleth euery of them to ſtryue to get in at the narrow gate: as if he had ſayde, it is not for you to be curious in ſerching of theſe things, but rather to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuer to go into heauen by the narrowe way. Therefore I lyke not the vngodly ſpeeches of ſome me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which ſay that few be choſen, and ſith I am not ſure whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I be of that no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber or no, I will not refrayne myne owne pleaſures. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſay, if I be predeſtinated or choſen of God, nothing ſhall put me from ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation which is certenly appointed for me, what ſo euer I do. And if I be of the nomber of the caſtawayes, no fayth or repentance can helpe me, bycauſe Gods determination cannot be chaunged: and therefore all teaching and warninges are to no purpoſe. For the Apoſtle fygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth againſte ſuche folke, ſaying: Gods ſeruant muſte be ready to teache and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct ſuche as ſtande againſt him,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2</note> if God at any tyme wyll gyue them repentance
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:17192:186"/> to know the truth. But Saint Auſtin in the .xiiii. chapter of his booke <hi>de bono per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerantiae,</hi> and in the chapters following, ſheweth that both of them be to be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: that is to wit, booth the grace of Gods free chooſing and predeſtinating, and alſo wholeſome warnings and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings. Therefore I miſlyke of ſuche as ſeeke without Chriſte whether they be choſen from euerlaſting or no: and what God hath determined of them before all tyme. For we muſt giue eare to the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell, and beleeue the ſame, and take it to be oute of all doubt, that if we beleue and be in Ieſus Chriſt, we be choſen. For the father hath vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto vs in Chriſte, the euerlaſting ſentence of his predeſtination, as I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared euen now, from oute of the firſte chapter of Paules ſecond Epiſtle to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie. Therefore we muſt teache, and conſyder aboue all thinges how greate the loue of the father is reueled to be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs in Chriſt. We muſt dayly her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken what the Lord himſelfe telleth vs in the Goſpel, how he calleth vs and ſaith,<note place="margin">
